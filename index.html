          <em class="darker">Why</em> Grids?
        </h3>

        <p>
          The grid has served as a foundational structure throughout the history of aesthetic culture and remains ubiquitous among art, architecture, design, and music that we perceive everyday. The grid is a powerful compositional device, but it's also much more: it's an icon, an interface, and an ideology. The grid does not simply organize units in a matrix, as a conceptual or material system for content, it posits a certain way of seeing and understanding the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          This page is both a tribute to, and tribunal on, the grid. It is meant to illustrate the pervasive role of grids in our civilization, to argue that this seemingly-neutral form is more complicated than it lets on. This page is also a demonstration of CSS Grid, a recently developed layout tool for web media, which is the basis for my creative engagement with the grid and its design properties.

          What <em>about</em> Grids?
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          "[T]he Paleolithic brick of ancient Mesopotamia, the first grid module, is rolled into a slab and stacked to make buildings and cities. These city grids in turn are projected onto the landscape as maps and coordinate systems whose measure suggests the measure of time that is foundational for musical composition. The “looking through” of map projections suggests, by various turns, moveable type and, when peeled up as a screen, the rudiments of Renaissance space and photography and the evolution of the Newtonian universe. With the invention of moveable type and modern mechanics, grids could be mass produced, effectively becoming a universal space. This universal space takes the form of the modernist boxes of architecture and painting alike, which then melt away into the ether of the Internet’s World Wide Web."

            <p>This diagram, by the Italian Renaissance theorist Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472), demonstrates the foundational theory of <strong>linear perspective</strong>. Perspective is a technique for analysing and reproducing the spatial organization of the observable world; that is, it models how the world appears from the eye's point of view. In this framework, visible matter traces back to a single, condensed point – the viewer - for whom everything is defined on a linear horizon. This conception of vision (although it forgets that we see things with two eyes) is profoundly influential for optics and Western art. It elaborates a mathematically precise technique for depicting three-dimensional space, and it forwards a philosophical basis for doing so. With linear perspective, artists could make pictures that appear like "a window onto the world," closing the gap between representation and reality. Although the idea that images should accurately reproduce vision may seem natural, it's very historically and culturally specific to modern Western thought. The presumption that art can, or should, reproduce an individual's perspective is based on highly constructed notions of art and human subjectivity. By attempting to illustrate an ostensibly objective model of ostensibly individual vision, Alberti's grid manifests a larger argument about the epistemological basis of perception.

            <p>This famous print, Albrecht Dürer's <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/366555">Draughtsman Making a Perspective Drawing of a Reclining Woman</a> (ca 1600) depicts a draughtsman translating three-dimensional objects onto a two-dimensional surface. Notice the devices he's using to frame the scene from a fixed point of view, along with the page that's organized into an analogous grid. By using the grid in this way, the draughtsman mirrors his visual perspective onto the page, such that his eye and hand seem to work as one; he thereby replicates the objects he sees along with the methods and technologies through which he sees them.<span></span>This illustration of vision and representation simultaneously demonstrates the efficacy of linear, grid-based perspective while laying bare the way it's constructed (in this case, literally implemented through tools for seeing). Moreover, this image raises larger questions about vision and subjectivity: who sees whom and how? How do gender and sexuality intersect with vision to determine how we observe bodies? How are these ways of looking naturalized or challenged through the purportedly objective grid?</p>

            <h3>Different <em>kinds</em> of grids</h3>
            <p>
              The grid is hardly as typical as one might think, and its different applications in different media testify to its formal diversity. The grid is not simply a graphic template we see, it's also something we experience in an immediate embodied way, as when we walk through cities or modern buildings, or when we hear music on standard time-signatures. The grid is also a conceptual structure that organizes intellectual categories (think of Myers-Briggs classifications, the periodic table, the "political compass", or, more abstractly, the way identity is charted on binary frameworks). The following are only five kinds of grids.
